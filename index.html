    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Livestock Management System – </b>Ardino Technologies
    At Ardino Technologies, I worked on developing a livestock management system aimed at helping farmers efficiently monitor and maintain data related to their cattle. The system enabled users to track animal health, vaccination schedules, feeding patterns, and milk production records through a centralized digital interface.</p></li>

            <li><p><b>Train Monitoring System – </b>Raspberry Pi Based Project
    As part of a hardware-based project, I developed a GPS-enabled train monitoring system using Raspberry Pi. The system was designed to track train movements in real-time, enhancing safety by detecting location and movement patterns along the railway tracks. The prototype also included features related to automated ticketing and data synchronization, offering a practical IoT-based solution for railway infrastructure management.</p> </li> </ul>
